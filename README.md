### Hello, I'm Annemarie ðŸ‘‹

I am a recently graduated machine learning engineer. I love designing and developing applications incorporating state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. I have a background in data science and technology, interaction technology and applied mathematics.

My previous GitHub is: https://github.com/AnnemarieJu, unfortunately it is subscribed to my old university email, so I have been locked out.

#### Public projects I have worked on:
- [Using trained prototypes for explainable AI](https://github.com/M-Nauta/Explaining_Prototypes)
- [Water simulation in space](https://github.com/robertoost/wet-planets)
- [Prototype interactive LED volleyball court](https://github.com/vikkyb/ITech-week2-assignment)
