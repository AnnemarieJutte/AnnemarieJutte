### Hello, I'm Annemarie ðŸ‘‹

I am a recently graduated machine learning engineer. I love designing and developing applications incorporating state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. I have a background in data science and technology, interaction technology and applied mathematics. In my free time I like to mess around with small programming projects for myself, like analyzing music using Spotipy.

My previous GitHub is: https://github.com/AnnemarieJutte, unfortunately it is subscribed to my old university email, so I have been locked out.
